Where x is the distance from the origin in the horizontal axis, y is the distance
from the origin in the vertical axis, and Ïƒ is the standard deviation of the
Gaussian distribution.

When applied in two dimensions, this formula produces a surface whose contours
are concentric circles with a Gaussian distribution from the center point.
